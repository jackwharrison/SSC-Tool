# Adding or Updating Regional Data  

**Important:** Administrative rights are required to edit or create ADM data. If you do not have the necessary permissions but believe you should, please contact your system administrator (**Jack Harrison â€“ jharrison@redcross.nl**).  

## Adding a New Country to the System  

Before using the system for a new country, you must first upload its administrative regions.  

This process involves multiple steps, as each administrative layer must be uploaded separately.  

**Note:** The system is only recommended for use if you have administrative data down to at least **ADM2**. Additionally, the system currently supports data up to **ADM3**.  

### Required Data for Each Administrative Layer (Template name shown in brackets)

**ADM0 (Country):**
- Country name (name)
- ADM0 PCODE (pcode)
- Population (pcode)
