# **Adding Data**

## **Adding Pillar Data** 

The template for importing data is very similar to the data for importing administrative regions.

Use the previous CSV from this process, if you are using gradient data, add one extra column, called 'value', and place the correct figure there.

If you are using categorical data, add several new columns, called critValue1, critValue2, etc, based on how many criteria there are in your indicator. Place the number or percentage of the population in each category here.

Access the import page <a href="http://172.201.122.141/#Import" target="_blank">here</a>.

In step 2 of the import page, there is a default values tab, here select 'Indicator':

Select your indicator and press 'Run Import'.

It is worth testing with a smaller file first, around 10 rows or so, to confirm you are happy with the way you have configured your indicator.
