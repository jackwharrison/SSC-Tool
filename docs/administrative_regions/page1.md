# Administrative Regions  

The SSC tool calculates scores for each administrative region, depending on data availability. It currently supports four levels of administrative regions, ranging from ADM0 to ADM3.  

- **ADM0** always represents the country.  
- **ADM1, ADM2, and ADM3** represent progressively smaller administrative divisions, though their specific names vary by country.
- There is also the option to store data at **ADM4** level, however it is not possible to calculate scores at this level

## Administrative Regions in the Tool  

Each administrative level is represented by a separate entity within the tool. While ADM1, ADM2, and ADM3 share a similar structure, ADM0 (the country level) is structured differently. The differences at ADM0 will be explained in detail later.
