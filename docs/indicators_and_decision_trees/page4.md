# Decision Tree Overview

This section allows users to **aggregate the three pillar scores** to determine an **overall severity score** using a **decision-tree approach**. The decision tree ensures that the aggregation process follows a structured sequence, where each score is considered step by step to determine the final result.

## **What is a Decision Tree in This Context?**  
A decision tree in this tool is a structured method for combining the three pillar scores (**Pillar 1, Pillar 2, and Pillar 3**) into a single **overall severity score**.  
- The process starts by evaluating **Pillar 1**, then moves to **Pillar 2**, and finally **Pillar 3**, following a predefined path.  
- The overall score is determined based on the sequence of scores and their assigned values.  

## **Fields**  
- **Name** – The name of the decision tree being used (Default Decision Tree).  
- **Pillar 1 Score** – The score assigned to **Pillar 1**.  
- **Pillar 2 Score** – The score assigned to **Pillar 2**.  
- **Pillar 3 Score** – The score assigned to **Pillar 3**.  
- **Overall Score** – The final aggregated severity score based on the decision tree logic.  

## **User Interaction**  
- Users can **cycle between different pillar scores** to see how the **overall severity score** changes.  
- This helps in **understanding how different conditions affect overall shelter severity**.  

## **Customization**  
- This **Default Decision Tree** is defined by the **Global Shelter Cluster team** and is used **by default for calculations**.  
- If necessary, users can **add their own decision tree** to modify how pillar scores contribute to the final severity score.
