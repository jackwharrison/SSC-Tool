# **Indicator Bank**

All pillar scores and baseline vulnerability scores are calculated using predefined indicators, which are created and managed within the indicator bank.

This section provides an overview of key metadata fields related to an indicator.  

- **Indicator Name** – The name of the indicator being displayed.  
- **Country** – The country for which the data applies.  
- **Data Type** – Specifies whether the data is **Categorical** (grouped into categories) or **Gradient** (numerical values).  
- **Indicator Weight** – A value indicating the relative importance of the indicator.  
- **Admin Level** – The administrative level at which the data is available (e.g., **ADM1** for regional data).  
- **Area or HH data?** – Indicates whether the data represents an **Area** or **Household** level dataset.  
- **Source** – A reference link to the original data source.

# Indicator Information Overview (Categorical Data)

This section provides details on an indicator, including its classification and scoring criteria. The displayed information is specific to **categorical data**, meaning the indicator is grouped into predefined categories rather than represented as a numerical value.

## Fields  

- **Timeframe** – Specifies whether the indicator applies to a pre-disaster, during-disaster, or post-disaster scenario.  
- **Indicator Category** – Defines the broader classification of the indicator, which determines its focus:  
  - **Pillar 1** – Assessing whether people can live in safe and dignified dwellings that protect them from external threats, health risks, weather, and natural hazards.  
  - **Pillar 2** – Evaluating whether people can live properly and with dignity in their dwellings and carry out domestic functions.  
  - **Pillar 3** – Determining whether people can access common services and infrastructure.  
  - **Baseline Vulnerability** – Covers factors that do not fit within the three pillars but influence shelter risk severity, such as poverty.  

## Pillars  

- **Pillar Definition** – Describes the aspect of shelter conditions that the indicator measures.  
- **Theme** – A broad category under the pillar (e.g., Energy).  
- **Sub-Theme** – A more specific category within the theme (e.g., Communications and Livelihoods - Energy).  

## Categories and Scoring  

- **Criteria** – The classification of conditions related to the indicator, each assigned a score:  
  - **Criteria 1** – Represents an optimal condition (e.g., "Available" = Score **0**).  
  - **Criteria 2** – Represents a partial fulfillment of the condition (e.g., "Partially Available" = Score **0.5**).  
  - **Criteria 3** – Represents a severe issue (e.g., "Not Available" = Score **1**).  
- **Values fitting each criteria** – Provides a description of the data that falls under each category.  
- **Threshold** – Defines the value used to assess severity.  
- **Default values for sub-theme** – Specifies whether the predefined scoring system is applied.  

### Notes:  
- The **criteria, scores, theme, and sub-theme** vary depending on which **pillar** is selected.  
- This structure ensures a standardized approach to classifying categorical data within shelter assessments.
