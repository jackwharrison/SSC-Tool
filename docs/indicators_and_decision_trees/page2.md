This section provides an overview of hazard risk indicators, which represent preprocessed calculations rather than dynamically generated data. Hazard risks are considered relatively stable over time, so calculations are performed externally and then added to the tool.  

## Fields  

- **Indicator Name** – Describes the specific hazard-related metric being measured.  
- **Hazard Type** – Specifies the type of hazard being assessed. The available hazard types include:  
  - **Typhoon**  
  - **Volcano**  
  - **Conflict**  
  - **Flood**  
  - **Earthquake**  
  - **Other**  
- **Admin Level** – Indicates the administrative level at which the data is available (e.g., ADM3 for municipality-level data).  
- **Country** – Identifies the country for which the hazard risk indicator applies.  
- **Source** – Displays the source of the data if available.  

## Level Definitions  

- **Severity Levels** – Hazard risk is categorized into severity levels, each with a predefined definition. For example:  
  - **Severity Definition 1** – No storm surge coverage.  
  - **Severity Definition 2** – Less than 1% storm surge coverage.  
  - **Severity Definition 3** – Between 1% and 2% storm surge coverage.  
  - **Severity Definition 4** – Between 2% and 5% storm surge coverage.  
  - **Severity Definition 5** – Over 5% storm surge coverage.  

These severity definitions help classify the extent of exposure to a given hazard at different thresholds. The specific criteria vary depending on the hazard type.  

### Notes:  
- Hazard data is **preprocessed** and added to the tool, rather than being calculated within the tool itself.  
- The classification structure ensures consistency in assessing hazard risk across different locations and administrative levels.
