# What is the SSC?

The SSC is the Shelter Severity Classification system and it aims to systematise analysis.

A shelter is more than four walls and a roof, it provides protection from the weather, it helps prevent people from becoming ill, a shelter provides a safe place for families to live and engage together, a shelter is often linked to livelihoods, they provide people with dignity and security, as well as much more. The SSC is an attempt to catch all that information and more in one system.

### Why do we need the SSC?

We need to be able to effectively answer the following questions:

1. Prioritisation and targeting - where and who should we target?
2. What interventions are most appropriate?
3. Are we having a positive impact?
