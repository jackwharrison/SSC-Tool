# What is the SSC?

The SSC, or Shelter Severity Classification system, streamlines analysis by capturing a wide range of critical shelter characteristics. A shelter is much more than four walls and a roof—it protects from the elements, helps prevent illness, and provides a secure, nurturing environment where families can live and thrive. Beyond offering basic safety, a well-designed shelter supports livelihoods, fosters dignity, and instills a sense of security. The SSC brings all these vital elements together in one comprehensive system.

## What do we need from the SSC?

We need to be able to effectively answer the following questions in the aftermath of an impact:

1. Prioritisation and targeting - where and who should we target?
2. What interventions are most appropriate?
3. Are we having a positive impact?

## How is the SSC made?

The primary output of the SSC is the overall shelter severity indicator, which is scored from one to five, with one being the least vulnerable, and five being the most vulnerable. This indicator tries to answer the following: can the household live with dignity and security of tenure in an adequate dwelling with access to community-level services and infrastructure.

To answer that, we have divided the components of a shelter into three pillars.

### **[Pillar 1 - The Shelter:](page2.md)** 
_The structure itself is an enclosed living space that protects from external threats. Defined as the percentage of households living in safe and dignified dwellings (structure that protects them against external threats, health problems, weather and natural hazards)_

**Themes:**

- **Physical Safety** - Percentage of households living in safe and secure shelters
- **Overcrowding and privacy** - Percentage of households living with sufficient space and privacy in their shelters
- **Habitability and Health** - Percentage of households living in shelters providing thermal comfort and healthy environment
- **Security of Tenure** - Percentage of households living with security of tenure
- **Accessibility** - Percentage of households living in shelters meeting accessibility standards


### **[Pillar 2 - Inside The Shelter:](page3.md)**

_People can live properly within their dwelling and perform their normal domestic functions. Defined as the percentage of households able to properly practice domestic functions_

**Themes:**

- **Thermal Comfort (Clothing)** – Percentage of households having sufficient and appropriate quality clothing
- **Energy** – Percentage of households having access to sufficient, safe, and affordable energy supply
- **Cooking** – Percentage of households having sufficient and appropriate items for cooking
- **Sleeping** – Percentage of households having sufficient and appropriate items for safe, healthy, and private sleeping
- **Cleanliness (Hygiene)** – Percentage of households having sufficient and appropriate items to maintain the shelter clean

### **[Pillar 3 - Outside The Shelter:](page4.md)** 

_People have access to common services and community infrastructure for their dwelling. Defined as percentage of households with access to appropriate common services and infrastructure_

- **Access to Services and Resources** - Percentage of households with access to common services and resources
- **Access to Communal Infrastructure** - Percentage of households with access to communal infrastructure
- **Hazards and Risks** - Percentage of households exposed to hazards and risks



## Scores / Phases

Each pillar has a score from one to five, and each score refers to a phase, which can be defined as such:

### **Phase 1 (None / Minimal):**

**Household level:** Household lives in adequate dwellings*, can perform all typical, core domestic functions, and has adequate access to all community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** at least 80% of households are living in shelter conditions described above

### **Phase 2 (Stressed):**

**Household level:** Household lives in adequate dwellings* (with minor issues), can perform most typical, core domestic functions, and has adequate access to most community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** up to 20% of households are living in shelter conditions described in phases 2+3+4+5 (less than 20% are in conditions described in phases 3+4+5)

### **Phase 3 (Crisis):**

**Household level:** Household lives in inadequate dwellings* (with significant issues), is unable to perform many typical, core domestic functions, and has limited adequate access to community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** at least 20% of households are living in shelter conditions described in phases 3+4+5 (less than 20% are in conditions described in phase 4+5)

### **Phase 4 (Critical):**

**Household level:** Household lives in inadequate dwellings* (with severe issues), is unable to perform most typical, core domestic functions, and has very limited adequate access to community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** at least 20% of households are living in shelter conditions described in phases 4+5 (less than 20% are in condition described in phase 5)

### **Phase 5 (Catastrophic):**

**Household level:** Household has no or is living in severely damaged dwelling*, is unable to perform all typical, core domestic function, and has no access to community-level services and infrastructure

**Area-level:** At least 20% of households are living in shelter conditions described above


*Adequate dwelling: safe and secure structure that protects against external threats, health problems, thermal discomfort, natural elements. 

**Note:** as much as possible, the key principles of adequate housing are applied, as considered possible in humanitarian contexts with generally limited availability of data.
